					<h2>About London Gallery List</h2>
						<p>
							I made London Gallery List because finding out what's on at the best galleries in London is too difficult.</p>
							<p>Hope you like it.</p>
							<p>If you've got thoughts on this very basic list of things that you'd like to share, <a href="https://twitter.com/joejulier">send me a message on twitter</a>.</p>



							<!-- This is because:<ol/>
							<li>Since this at there got closed there is no longer a website you can go for reliable information on the best shows</li>
							<li>Finding a show involves remembering all the good galleries/museums in London, we usually forget the one that actually has something good on.</li>
							<li>Gallery/museum websites are usually difficult to navigate because they focus on persuasion instead of usability</li> -->
