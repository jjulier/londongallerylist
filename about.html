					<h2>About London Gallery List</h2>
						<p>
							I made this because finding out what's on at galleries in London is harder than it needs to be.</p>
							<p>I hope you like it.</p>
							<p>If you have any thoughts or questions about the website, please <a href="https://twitter.com/joejulier">send me a message</a>.</p>



							<!-- This is because:<ol/>
							<li>Since this at there got closed there is no longer a website you can go for reliable information on the best shows</li>
							<li>Finding a show involves remembering all the good galleries/museums in London, we usually forget the one that actually has something good on.</li>
							<li>Gallery/museum websites are usually difficult to navigate because they focus on persuasion instead of usability</li> -->
